Handles domain-specific errors and maps them to appropriate HTTP exceptions.\nThis function checks if the error belongs to specific domain error classes (e.g., Post errors) and\nthrows an HttpException with the correct HTTP status code and error message. If the error doesn't match any\nknown domain error, a generic internal server error is thrown.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                error\n\n                                            \n                                                    No\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    \nThe error object to handle.\n\n\n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                            Returns :     never\n\n                        \n                            \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        isMongoDbIdValid\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \nisMongoDbIdValid(id)\n                \n            \n\n\n\n\n            \n                \n                        Checks if a given string is a valid MongoDB ObjectId.\nThis function uses Mongoose's ObjectId.isValid method to determine if the provided string\nis a valid representation of a MongoDB ObjectId.

You can download the MongoDB Community Server from here.\n📝 Rename .env.example to .env and replace the values with your own MongoDB connection details and desired api port.\n🚀 Run npm start to start the server.\n\n🐳 Running with Docker\nTo run the project with Docker, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine.\n\n🍴 Clone this repository to your local machine.\n\n📝 Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env. Open the .env file and specify the desired values for MONGODB_URI and PORT variables.\nFor example:\nExample :# The MongoDB connection string for the BlogPost database\nMONGODB_URI=\"mongodb://mongodb/test\"\n# The port on which the Blog CMS API will run\nPORT=\"3000\"\n# The seed string to be used for the JwtStrategy\nJWT_SECRET=\"42\"\n🐳 Run docker compose build to build the containers.\n\n🐳 Run docker compose up to start the containers.\n\n🌍 The API will be available at http://localhost:3000/.\n\n\n📖 Usage\nOnce the server is running, you can use the following endpoints to manage your blog posts:\n\nGET /api/v1/posts: Returns a list of all posts.\nPOST /api/v1/posts: Creates a new post.\nGET /api/v1/posts?page&limit: Get Posts with pagination based on created date.\nGET /api/v1/posts?slug=:slug: Returns a specific post by slug.\nGET /api/v1/posts/:id: Returns a specific post by post ID.\nDELETE /api/v1/posts/:id: Deletes a post by post ID.\nGET /api/v1/posts/:id/relations: Returns relationship posts by post ID\nPOST /api/v1/posts/relation/?sourcePostId&relationPostId: Sets a relationship between two posts.\nGET /heath: Returns useful system information, such as server uptime and memory usage. This endpoint can be used to monitor the health of the application.\n\nNote: The current pagination implementation is based on the page and limit query parameters and orders the results based on created date in ascending order.\n🚀 Future Improvements\nHere are some potential improvements that could be made to this project:\n\n Add support for updating post content\n Add support for media uploads (images, videos, etc.).\n Add support for more auth providers (Auth0,OAuth2 etc)\n Create a frontend interface for post management.\n Implement a more robust pagination solution that allows for custom sorting and filtering.\n Add support for different languages and locales.\n Write jest tests\n Add a process manager\n Add Github Actions to publish image to Docker Hub, Github Registry etc.\n\n✅ Completed Tasks\nHere are the tasks that have already been completed in this project:\n\n✅ Further optimize the Docker images to reduce size, making the deployment process faster and more efficient.\n✅ Rewrite the project in TypeScript for better type safety.\n✅ Refactor the project using the NestJs framework for better code organization and modularity.\n✅ Add support for comments in each post: Users and non-users can add comments to posts and engage in discussions.\n✅ Implement authentication to secure the API.\n✅ Add support for user: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profile.\n✅ Have multiple users create their own posts: Each user can create their own posts and manage them.\n\n🤝 Contributing\nContributions to this project are welcome!
